# US Visa Bot ü§ñ

An automated bot that monitors and reschedules US visa interview appointments to get you an earlier date.

## Features

- üîÑ Continuously monitors available appointment slots
- üìÖ Automatically books earlier dates when found  
- üéØ Configurable target and minimum date constraints
- üö® Exits successfully when target date is reached
- üìä Detailed logging with timestamps
- üîê Secure authentication with environment variables

## How It Works

The bot logs into your account on https://ais.usvisa-info.com/ and checks for available appointment dates every few seconds. When it finds a date earlier than your current booking (and within your specified constraints), it automatically reschedules your appointment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- A valid US visa interview appointment
- Access to https://ais.usvisa-info.com/

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/us-visa-bot.git
cd us-visa-bot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

| `--dry-run` | `--dry-run` | ‚ùå | Only log what would be booked without actually booking |

### Examples

node index.js

# Dry run mode - see what would be booked without actually booking

# Get help
node index.js --help
```

## How It Behaves

The bot will:
1. **Log in** to your account using provided credentials
2. **Check** for available dates every few seconds
3. **Compare** found dates against your constraints:
   - Must be within the date range (MIN_DATE to MAX_DATE)
   - Takes into account DAYS_BEFORE_BOOKING for minimum date calculation
   - Must be earlier than any current booking if one exists
4. **Book** the appointment automatically if conditions are met
5. **Continue** monitoring until target is reached or manually stopped
